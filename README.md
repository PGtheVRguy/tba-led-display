A utilization of the rpi-rgb-led-matrix and tbapy libraries for python. 

With this repo, a 64x32 rgb led matrix can display data pulled from The Blue Alliance! Simply run the command "sudo python3 main.py [teamNum] [comp]"! Example: "sudo python3 main.py 7211 2024miwmi"!!





This was NOT made on behalf of First Robotics or The Blue Alliance, all trademarks belong to them and other legal stuff similar to that. I just wanna have a cool way to view matches :3
